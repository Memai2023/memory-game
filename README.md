# Assignment 3 - Memory Game - Testing
A memory game is a simple card-based game where players aim to match pairs of cards. The cards are placed face down, and players take turns flipping over two cards at a time. If the cards match, they remain face up; if not, they are turned back face down. The game continues until all pairs are matched. It tests and improves concentration, memory, and recognition skills.
## Game Start
The Game starts with 16 cards flipped on the backside.
